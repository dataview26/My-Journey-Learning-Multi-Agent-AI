## Results
=== SCRATCHPAD TRANSCRIPT ===
[Planner] Plan week-1 learning: 1) Set up env 2) Read basics 3) Run toy agent.
[Worker] Week 1 plan:
- Create repo & scaffold
- Read intro on multi-agent systems
- Implement Planner→Worker toy
- Log results + reflection
[Critic] Critic review: Good plan — consider adding timelines or reflections.


## Reflection
The Critic correctly reviewed the plan and gave feedback about improving structure and adding timelines. 
Next step: test a scoring or checklist system for better evaluation.

## Next
Add a simple score (e.g., 0–2) and checklist for the Critic to judge quality.
