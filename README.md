# My Journey Learning Multi-Agent AI

> A public research log of my ongoing experiments building and understanding multi-agent systems — how independent AI agents can collaborate, reason, and solve tasks together.

## 🧩 About

I’m a **Research Engineer in Agentic AI**, documenting my hands-on journey learning how intelligent agents communicate, coordinate, and reason collectively.

This repository is my open notebook — every experiment, reflection, and insight lives here.

The goal is simple:
> **Build understanding by building systems.**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🧠 Explore the foundations of **multi-agent coordination**  
- 🧪 Reproduce simple agent patterns (Planner → Worker → Critic)  
- 🧰 Experiment with **memory, tool use, and reflection loops**  
- 🗂 Log experiments clearly and reproducibly  
- 📈 Grow this into a practical agent research playground
