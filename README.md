# My Journey Learning Multi-Agent AI

> A public research log of my ongoing experiments building and understanding multi-agent systems — how independent AI agents can collaborate, reason, and solve tasks together.

## 🧩 About

I’m a **Research Engineer in Agentic AI**, documenting my hands-on journey learning how intelligent agents communicate, coordinate, and reason collectively.

This repository is my open notebook — every experiment, reflection, and insight lives here.

The goal is simple:  
> **Build understanding by building systems.**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🧠 Explore the foundations of **multi-agent coordination**  
- 🧪 Reproduce simple agent patterns (Planner → Worker → Critic)  
- 🧰 Experiment with **memory, tool use, and reflection loops**  
- 🗂 Log experiments clearly and reproducibly  
- 📈 Grow this into a practical agent research playground

## ⚙️ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/My-Journey-Learning-Multi-Agent-AI.git
cd My-Journey-Learning-Multi-Agent-AI

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # (Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

Run your first experiment:
$env:PYTHONPATH="src"
python -m journey_agents.run_experiment --name "hello-multi-agent"
